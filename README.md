# ParaLex
Paradigmatic term clusters in multiple languages - a resource for evaluating word spaces and other semantic similarity models.

The dataset consists of thematic word lists that represent a number of different semantic 
paradigms, such as days of the week, months of the year and common fruit and vegetables. 
The evaluation data has been translated to more than 45 different languages.
